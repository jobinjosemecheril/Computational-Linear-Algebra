# Python for Linear Algebra
## Pseudocode: the new language for algorithm design

Pseudocode is a way to describe algorithms in a structured but plain language. It helps in planning the logic without worrying about the syntax of a specific programming language. 
In this module, weâ€™ll use Python-flavored pseudocode to describe various matrix operations.

## Matrix Sum
#### Mathematical Procedure:
To add two matrices $A$ and $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The sum $C$ of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated element-wise:
$$C[i][j]=A[i][j]+B[i][j]$$
