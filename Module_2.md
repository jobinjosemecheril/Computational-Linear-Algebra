# Transforming Linear Algebra to Computational Language
## Introduction

In the first module, we established a solid foundation in matrix algebra by exploring pseudocode and implementing fundamental matrix operations using Python. We practiced key concepts such as matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and determinants through practical examples in image processing, leveraging the `SymPy` library for symbolic computation.

As we begin the second module, **“Transforming Linear Algebra to Computational Language,”** our focus will shift towards applying these concepts with greater depth and actionable insight. This module is designed to bridge the theoretical knowledge from matrix algebra with practical computational applications. You will learn to interpret and utilize matrix operations, solve systems of equations, and analyze the rank of matrices within a variety of real-world contexts.

A new concept we will introduce is the **Rank-Nullity Theorem**, which provides a fundamental relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimensions of its null space. This theorem is crucial for understanding the solution spaces of linear systems and the properties of linear transformations. By applying this theorem, you will be able to gain deeper insights into the structure of solutions and the behavior of matrix transformations.

This transition will not only reinforce your understanding of linear algebra but also enhance your ability to apply these concepts effectively in computational settings. Through engaging examples and practical exercises, you will gain valuable experience in transforming abstract mathematical principles into tangible solutions, setting a strong groundwork for advanced computational techniques.

## Relearning of Terms and Operations in Linear Algebra
In this section, we will revisit fundamental matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, scaling, and more through practical examples. Our goal is to transform theoretical linear algebra into modern computational applications. We will demonstrate these concepts using Python, focusing on practical and industrial applications.

### Matrix Addition and Subtraction in Data Analysis

Matrix addition and subtraction are fundamental operations that help in combining datasets and analyzing differences.

**Simple Example: Combining Quarterly Sales Data**

We begin with quarterly sales data from different regions and combine them to get the total sales.

**Tabular Data:**

|Region	|Q1	|Q2	|Q3	|Q4|
|--- |--- |---|---|---|
|A	|2500	|2800	|3100	|2900|
|B	|1500	|1600	|1700	|1800|

**From Scratch Python Implementation:**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Quarterly sales data
sales_region_a = np.array([2500, 2800, 3100, 2900])
sales_region_b = np.array([1500, 1600, 1700, 1800])

# Combine sales data
total_sales = sales_region_a + sales_region_b

# Visualization
quarters = ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4']
plt.bar(quarters, total_sales, color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Quarter')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.title('Combined Quarterly Sales Data for Regions A and B')
plt.show()
```
